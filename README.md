Statistical Methods in Machine Learning

-	Implemented and evaluated Logistic Regression, SVM (linear & RBF), and KNN classifiers on MNIST data, achieving 96.67% accuracy with RBF SVM.
-	Applied PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization; t-SNE outperformed PCA in maintaining classification accuracy.
-	Tuned model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.
- Used smooth bootstrap and KDE on PCA embeddings to augment the dataset with new images.
